/***
 *
 * This project helps us manage our inventory.
 * We already have some processes which get us CSV data in Google Drive
 * This project will automatically pull those CSV files into AirTable for us.
 *
 * Code lives here: https://github.com/thinkle/airtable-google-drive-connector
 *
 * Just add a Secrets.js file with necessary credentials / file IDs etc, which are:
 * const staffCSVID
 * const studentCSVID
 * const AirTableKey
 * const StaffEndpoint
 * const StudentEndpoint
